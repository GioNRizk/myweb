        Infrastructure refers to the framework or architecture that constitutes a system.
        For instance, a country's transportation infrastructure encompasses roads, railroads, airports, ports, and
        rivers.
        Similarly, the Internet operates on an infrastructure composed of various elements, each playing a crucial role
        in transmitting information.
        <br>
        The development of Internet infrastructure can be traced back to the 1960s when the US government,
        particularly the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),
        provided funding for research in packet-switched technology.
        This revolutionary approach laid the foundation for ARPANET, the precursor of the modern Internet.
        DARPA, along with the Defense Communications Agency and Stanford University,
        played pivotal roles in the creation of Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP),
        which defined how information would flow across the Internet.
        <br>
        Every device connected to the Internet is part of a network, including the one in your home.
        For instance, your computer may utilize a cable or fiber modem to connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
        At work, your device may be integrated into a local area network (LAN), with internet access provided by your
        employer's ISP.
        This connection ultimately links to a larger network. The internet is essentially a network of networks.
        <br>
        Major communications companies have their dedicated backbones,
        which are always-on connections with sufficient bandwidth to accommodate multiple users simultaneously.
        In each region, a company maintains a local office that connects homes and businesses to its primary network.
        Remarkably, the Internet operates without a centralized network.
        Traffic moves from point to point, and in the event of a computer dropping out of the network,
        the packets constituting a digital file are re-routed to another computer.
        Files arrive as expected, with any alterations in traffic pattern going unnoticed.
        <br>
        One of the remarkable features of the Internet is that it is a global amalgamation of networks,
        both large and small, interconnected in various ways to form the cohesive entity we recognize today.
