    The World Wide Web, established by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, is a global platform accessed via internet-connected computers. 
    Berners-Lee introduced key elements like hyperlinks, web servers, browsers, and HTML, a document formatting protocol. 
    This innovation led to the development of various web browsers, notably Marc Andreessen's user-friendly Mosaic, 
    which played a pivotal role in the 1990s Internet boom. 
    HTML's capabilities evolved, resulting in versions 2, 3, 4, and ultimately HTML5 in 2014. 
    The language was further enriched with advanced formatting through CSS and JavaScript. 
    Berners-Lee launched the first Web server and browser in late 1990. 
    Initially designed for scientific information-sharing, the WWW merged computing, data networks, 
    and hypertext into a user-friendly global information system.

To grasp the World Wide Web, it's crucial to understand its fundamental components:
<br>
<ol>
<li> URLs: These define a web page's location or provide access to specific resources online. </li>
<br>
<li>HTML: This readable language is understood by web browsers and stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</li>
<br>
<li>HTTP: It encompasses the protocols governing the internet.</li>
<br>
</ol>
Regarding the number of websites, as of September 12, 2022, there were over 1.98 billion active online.
